### Device Owner (Non ROOT) Mode Setup

### Notice:
- Due to limitations of the MIUI system such as Xiaomi, Hide App feature may be invalid. Please activate it with caution.
- The latest test version (354) of the Huawei EMUI system for non-intra-mobile push updates. After activating the ADB, there may be a problem that the mobile phone restarts and loses individual system apps. Please activate it with caution. If this problem occurs, uninstall the app and restart the phone to restore it.
- Please clear the lock screen password before Samsung S8+ Android8.0 is activated. After ADB is activated, it may cause the administrator to lock and inaccessible after booting, and may cause problems such as facial recognition unusable. Please activate it with caution.
